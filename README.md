Coding Practice
===============

What is it?
-----------

This repository contains a bunch of problems in programming written in differing styles and languages. The repository does not serve any useful purpose apart from facilitating my own learning as I work through the 'Cracking the Coding Interview' by Gayle Laakmann.

Anything Else I Should Know?
----------------------------

Just two things, the code in the Java section uses the JUnit framework for simple testing. Within Java/Makefile there are two variables `JUNITPATH` and `HAMCRESTPATH` which should point to the JUnit and Hamcrest Core jar files respectively, obtainable from [http://www.junit.org](). 
Finally, code in this repository will be entirely written by myself unless stated otherwise. The Apache v2 Licence for which all my code applies has been included in the repository.
