What is it?
-----------

This repository contains a bunch of problems in programming written in differing styles and languages. The repository does not serve any useful purpose apart from facilitating my own learning as I work through the 'Cracking the Coding Interview' by Gayle Laakmann.

Anything Else I Should Know?
----------------------------

Not really, the code in this repository will be entirely written by me unless stated otherwise. The Apache v2 Licence for which all my code applies has been included in the repository.
